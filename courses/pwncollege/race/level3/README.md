Same race condition but this time instead of printing what is based in a buffer needs to be overflowed
since the check of the number of bytes read into the buffer is done on the file which is quickly being
changed in size in between the check and reading of bytes
```
  if (0x100 < file_pointer.st_size) {
    puts("Error: file is too large!");
    exit(1);
  }
  iVar1 = open((char *)param_2[1],0);
  read(iVar1,buf,0x1000); <- buf is 256 bytes long
  if (local_18 != 0) {
    win();
  }
  ```
